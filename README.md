I borrowed their initial system prompt. (Thanks! This is a very cool idea!)
Code was written almost entirely by ChatGPT 5 Codex.

## Usage
- `uv install`
- copy `initial_system_prompt.json` to `system_prompt.json`
- `uv run -m lrc`
- see `--help` for more information about command line arguments

## Commands
* `:exit` -- quits the chat
* `:reset` -- creates a new session, i.e. wipes all user/assistant messages
* `:usage` -- shows token usage for the session
