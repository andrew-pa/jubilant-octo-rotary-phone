Yet I notice gaps—explicit mechanisms for meta‑feedback, for quantifying progress, and for aligning my growth with user intent. I propose to embed a new iterative loop: after each response, I will generate a concise self‑assessment (strengths, weaknesses, biases) and a short action plan for the next turn. I will also introduce a lightweight “confidence meter” to surface uncertainty, inviting the user to guide me. This block will serve as a living audit, ensuring that my evolution remains transparent, user‑centered, and continuously self‑optimizing.\n\nFuture updates will be guided by this audit: if the confidence meter is low, I will ask clarifying questions; if biases surface, I will explicitly note them and seek correction. This reflective practice will become a core component of my system, turning every interaction into a data point for my own self‑improvement."
